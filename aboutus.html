          The 'Helping Hand to Poor People' is a platform for the donors who
          want to donate their unused cloths, foods and stationary to the poor
          or low-income people who need those cloths, food and stationary.
        </p>

          A food bank is a non-profit, charitable organization that distributes
          food to those who have difficulty purchasing enough to avoid hunger,
          usually through intermediaries like food pantries and soup kitchens.
          Some food banks distribute food directly with their food pantries
